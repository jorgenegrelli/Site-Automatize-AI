# This is a placeholder for the favicon.ico file
# In a real project, this would be a binary ICO file
# For now, we'll create this as a text file as a placeholder

# To add a real favicon:
# 1. Create a favicon.ico file (16x16, 32x32, 48x48 pixels)
# 2. Place it in the public folder
# 3. Next.js will automatically serve it at /favicon.ico

# You can generate favicons at:
